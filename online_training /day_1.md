# 📘 README: Data Management & Governance Training Summary

## 💎 Data as an Asset

* Unlike money, data doesn’t get consumed.
* Data can be reused for analytics without depletion.
* Treated as a long-term organizational asset.
  
* **What is data management?**
  * Architectural handling of data: structure, flow, and access.
  * Encompasses ETL, storage, pipelining, and quality.
 protection and enhance the data value


## 🔐 Data Security and Policy

* Sensitive data like credit cards must be hashed/encrypted.
* Internal data must be classified and protected.
* Controls must be enforced for visibility and usage.

## 🧱 Core Principles of Data Management

| Principle               | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📈 Data as an Asset     | Data holds value, never consumed, always reusable.                   |
| 🛠️ Metadata Management | Manage "data about data" (e.g., column names, table descriptions).   |
| 🔒 Security & Privacy   | Classify, encrypt, and restrict access based on sensitivity.         |
| 📊 Data Quality         | Accurate, consistent, complete, timely, and valid data.              |
| 🔁 Lifecycle Planning   | Manage creation → usage → archival/destruction.                      |
| 🤝 Interoperability     | Ensure seamless flow across tools/systems (e.g., Calibra ↔ Tableau). |
| 🧭 Governance-Driven    | Policies, roles, and ownership must be in place.                     |
| 💰 ROI-Oriented         | Communicate data’s business value in economic terms.                 |

## 🧾 Metadata

* Defined as "data about data".
* Example: column headers in Excel.
* Metadata explains structure, content, and type.

---

## 🗂️ System of Record (SoR)(cosumption of dataonly from the trusted resource)
* **Definition:** The **original, authoritative source** where a data element is first captured and maintained.
* * Essential for lineage and data tracing.
* **Examples:** SQL Server, CRM, Excel uploads from field teams.
* **Not SoRs:** BI Tools, Calibra, which *reference* but do not originate data.
* **Usage:** For audits, lineage, integrity verification.

---
## 📉 Data Quality

* Common issues: inconsistent formats, outdated records, duplicates.
* Example: DOB format inconsistency — MMDDYY vs DDMMYY.
* Data quality must be defined per business group.
* Continuous monitoring is essential — it’s a program, not a project.

## 🛡️ Governance Framework

Involves handling:

* Data architecture and modelling (star, snowflake, layered e.g., bronze/silver/gold).
* Data storage (SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, HDFS).
* Security: prevention of breaches and leaks.
* Interoperability between tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Collibra.
* Document management (e.g., SharePoint).

## 🧠 Techno-Functional Roles in Collibra

* Collibra supports blending of technical data with business terms.
* Example: map `FRST_NM` to "First Name".
* Users must understand both data context and business semantics.

## 📂 Reference vs Master Data

* **Reference Data**: Static values (e.g., currency, country codes).
* **Master Data**: Unique identifiers (e.g., customer CIF ID in banking).

## 🎯 Data Management Goals

* Serve stakeholder needs — internal and external.
* Preserve privacy and confidentiality.
* Enable data sharing with proper access controls.
* Support data lifecycle (creation → storage → archival → deletion).

## 🏢 Organizational Impact

* Data breaches cause financial and reputational harm.
* Legacy systems often lack documentation; governance helps bridge the gap.
* Good practices enable handovers, continuity, and data reuse.

## 🔃 Governance Components

Includes:

* Data quality management.
* Metadata management.
* Policy documentation.
* Data modelling and architecture.
* Reference/master data frameworks.

## 🛠️ Program vs Project

* **Project**: Temporary, like this training (e.g., 6 weeks).
* **Program**: Ongoing effort, like maintaining data quality.


## 💰 Return on Investment (ROI)

### Why It Matters:

To justify investments in tools like Calibra, governance programs, and DQ remediation.

### ROI Comes From:

* Reduced manual work via automation.
* Fewer data incidents and improved trust.
* Faster access to clean, usable data.
* Enabling better analytics and decision-making.

### Example:

> Implementing metadata controls reduced reporting delays by 40%, saving 200 hours/month across departments.

## 🛠️ Calibra Tool Overview

| Feature                   | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🏢 Communities/Domains    | Org structure to manage roles and areas.     |
| 📚 Business Glossary      | Business-friendly term definitions.          |
| 🧱 Asset Management       | Tables, columns, files, systems.             |
| 🔗 Traceability           | Lineage of how data flows/transforms.        |
| 🔄 Techno-Functional Role | Merges technical data with business context. |

---

## 📊 Data Quality as a Continuous Program

* **NOT a one-time project.**
* Covers:

  * Format checks (e.g., consistent DOB format)
  * Null handling
  * Duplicates & uniqueness
  * Monitoring pipelines
* Tied directly to **Data Governance** for policy enforcement.

## 📚 Closing Thoughts

* **Good data = good decisions.**
* **Governance is continuous.**
* Calibra + strong metadata + well-defined policies = scalable data ecosystem.
* Always ask:

  > “How does this data bring measurable business value?”
